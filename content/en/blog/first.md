## Example text

I use this blog as a baseline for my future blogs.

Once upon a time, there was a wise man. He was eager to learn.\
Throughout his entire life, he always searched for meaning.\
He wondered if he had any free will, or if the timeline of his life was
already well-defined, from one end to another.\
To study a physical phenomenon, we often need to know two things, he though: \
the equation which describes how a physical phenomenon behaves, and its initial conditions. \
So, he reasoned, we do have free will because we aren't able to calculate our future.\
Just like in chess.\
And that's why life is such a good game, you never know what you'll get and where you'll end up.\
Unless if you're playing against a fast computer, then it's less fun.
