About Me \

Career: \
I'm an Engineer, having graduated in France in 2019.\
I have a general engineering degree, but I mostly focus on
software programming as it allows me to render my thoughts more effectively,
and also because I've always been a computer nerd.

\
Projects I love: \
Ambitious projects with many moving parts that move people forward.\
Cutting-edge or futuristic technologies.\
Social networks.\
\
Other: \

Work conditions:\
60k+ for remote
90k+ for non-remote in Paris, although I am willing to move.
Soon available for freelancing work.
I do accept dark web requests (Contact me for details)
