This is the frontend of my portfolio website: a web app that is statically generated at build time via Vue and NuxtJS and hosted on Github Pages, with Github Actions triggering redeployments on new commits. \
The backend for the /contact page can be found on my [aws-lambda-ses-recaptcha](https://github.com/Emrin/aws-lambda-ses-recaptcha) repository.
